Hey Folks!

This Weather Forecast GUI App is built using Python and two well know Python libraries - "Requests" and "Customtkinter".

To run this app on your PC or Laptop you will need to install both the libraries used for building the application.

To install the libraries:

Open Terminal or Windows Powershell 
Type "pip install customtkinter" and hit enter, and it will automatically install the Library for you
After customtkinter is installed, repeat the process but this time replace "customtkinter" with "requests"
